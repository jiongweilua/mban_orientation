# Introduction

- The Circle of Data Science
- The Tidyverse
- The Data 

## Data Science Is: 

- Gathering **data that matters.**
- Asking **questions that matter** about your data. 
- **Choosing appropriate methods**  to answer those questions. 
- **Implementing solutions** that meets stakeholder needs. 

## My Favorite Picture

<div class='fragment'>
```{r, out.height = 400, out.width = 500, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/spongebob_hopeful.jpg')
```
</div>

## My Favorite Picture

<div class='fragment'>
```{r, out.height = 400, out.width=800, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/patrickstewartwide.jpg')
```
</div>

## My ~~Favorite~~ Second Favorite Picture 

```{r, out.height = 300, out.width = 800, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

> - **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** covers roughly the "transform" and "visualize" steps. 

## EDA is getting to know your Data

```{r, out.height = 650, out.width = 500, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

## You Can Do Data Science With:

> - A pencil and paper.
> - A calculator.
> - Excel.
> - Coding: `R`, `Julia`, `Python`.... 

## Why Not Excel?

- **Flexibility:** 
	- Limited statistics/ML
	- Poor visualizations
- **Reproducibility:** 
	- Platform limited 
	- Can't version control
	- Difficult to inspect code/troubleshoot
- **Scalability:** 
	- Excel can handle ~1M rows at best
</div>

## Why Code?

<div id='left'>

- **Flexibility:**
	- "There's a package for that"
	- Custom analysis and visualization
- **Reproducibility:**
	- Cross-platform, often FOSS 
	- Version-control with `git`
	- Easy to inspect code
- **Scalability:** 
	- `R` and `python`: ~10M rows easily on a laptop.
	
</div>

## Version Control with `git` 

>- Break your workflow into manageable stages; easily collaborate; access cool code. 
>- Promote your brand: share your work, build a portfolio, [host your website](https://pages.github.com). 
>- Used at: Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, Microsoft... (*[source](https://www.quora.com/What-companies-use-Git)*)

## Data Analysis with  `R`

> - `R` is **the best** language in the world for **learning** data science.
> - `R` is **one of the best** languages in the world for **doing** data science. 
> - `R` tends to be preferred in academia and among "statisticians," while `python` is more popular among "computer scientists" and "data scientists"
> - Most practicing data scientists know and use both. 

## Optimization with `Julia` and `JuMP` 

>- `Julia` is high-performance, open-source dynamic language for technical computing -- easy writing, fast compute times.
>- Developed at MIT.
>- `JuMP` is a package for optimization in `Julia` -- developed by ORC students!
>- Not everyone uses `Julia`...yet. 

## *...yes, there will be an opportunity to learn `Python` later in the semester.* {.noborder}

## What can you pick up in two days? 

> - You are not going to become an expert in two days. 
> - But...
> - You will know the **basic concepts** and **vocabulary** of data science -- enough to employ the most important skill of all.

2. **Tomorrow**: Optimization in `Julia` and `JuMP`, selected presentations.
3. **Both days**: mini-project, partner work, lots of exercises.

knitr::include_graphics('https://imgs.6sqft.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10102308/airbnb-logo.jpg')
```

## The Data

- Scraped by [InsideAirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/), "an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world."
- Includes `listings` info, a `calendar` of prices, and texts of `reviews`. We'll be using the first two data sets today. 
- Data given for mid-2019 through mid-2020 (for prices and availability). 

# Fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Reading and inspecting data. 
2. The pipe operator. 
3. Data wrangling.

## Pipes for your Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 500, out.width = 500}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/Data_with_pipe.jpg')
```

## Pipes for your Data

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 200, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/3632/small/1419844831/magrittr.png')
```

> - `x %>% f()` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `f(x)` 
> - *"Take `x`, and **then** do `f` to it"*
> - `x %>% f(y)` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `f(x,y)`
> - `x %>% f(y) %>% g(z)` $\Longleftrightarrow$ `g(f(x,y),z)` 
> - *"Take `x`, **then** do `f` with option `y`, **then** do `g` with option `z`..."*

## Exercises and Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE}

listings %>% glimpse()  # = glimpse(listings)
listings %>% head()     # = head(listings)
listings %>% colnames() # = colnames(listings)

listings %>%                             
	select(contains('review_scores'))  # what does this do? 

listings %>% 
	select(contains('review_scores')) %>%  # what about this? 
	colnames()
```

Ok, back to the script to put this in action. 


# Data Visualization

1. Graphical Excellence
2. The Grammar of Graphics
3. `ggplot2`

## My Second Favorite Picture:

```{r, out.height = 300, out.width = 800, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/images/tidy1.png')
```

## Graphical Excellence

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 550, out.width = 900}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/images/0003VL-9150.jpeg")
```

## Graphical Excellence

> Graphical excellence is the **well-designed presentation of interesting data** -- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design. Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with **clarity**, **precision**, and **efficiency**. 

-- *Edward Tufte*

## Graphical Excellence ([edwardtufte.com](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/images/0003Cs-8047.GIF))

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 1000, out.height = 600}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/images/0003Cs-8047.GIF")
```

## The Grammar of Graphics

A **grammar** is a set of components (ingredients) that you can combine to create complex structures (sentences, recipes, data visualizations). In baking....

<div id="left">

- **A body** -- typically some kind of flour)
- **Binder** -- eggs, oil, butter, applesauce
- **A rising agent** -- yeast, baking soda, baking powder
- **Flavoring** -- sugar, salt, chocolate, vanilla
- Get it wrong, and...
</div>

<div id='right'>
<div class='fragment'>
```{r, out.height = 350, out.width = 400, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mary.png")
```
</div>
</div>

## The Grammar of Graphics

- Puts the `gg` in `ggplot2`. 
- Formulated by Leland Wilkinson.
- Implemented in code by Hadley Wickham, now part of the `tidyverse`

<div id='left'>
```{r, out.height = 350, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZIHtc9TJL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg")
```
</div>
<div id='right'>
```{r, out.height = 350, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://pix-media.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/1001/HadleyObama2.png")
```
</div>

## Ingredients of a data visualization 

> - **`Data`**:  almost always a `data_frame` 
> - **`Aes`**thetic mapping: relation of data to chart components.
> - **`Geom`**etry: specific visualization type? E.g. line, bar, heatmap?
> - **`Stat`**istical transformation: how should the data be transformed or aggregated before visualizing?
> - **`Theme`**: how should the non-data parts of the plot look?
> - Misc. other options. 
> - (`+` plays the same role in `ggplot2` that `%>%` does in data manipulation.)

# Literate Programming with R Markdown

## Literate Programming

The idea of *literate programming* is to collect your code, outputs, and explanatory narrative in a single, convenient document that can meet the needs of multiple stakeholders.  

## R Markdown

- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) is an authoring format for creating attractive documents, slides, websites, and more using `R`. 
- These slides are written in RMarkdown ([source here](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/1_orientation/2_data_science/index.html)). 
- We are going to take a quick tour of R Markdown features before jumping into your mini-project for today. 

# Mini-Project

## The Setup

>- You are a seasoned data scientist who has just arrived in Boston.
>- You're want to go see the sights, but you don't know where they are!
>- Instead of buying a tourist guide like a Muggle would, you are going to use your skills in exploratory data analysis to find cool spots to visit. 

## What You'll Make

Like [this](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/1_orientation/2_data_science/code/dashboard.html), but way better. 

## Instructions 

- Your **deliverable** is `dashboard.rmd`, which you can find in the `1_orientation/2_data_science/code` directory. You should have checked that this `knit` correctly in the preassignment. 
- Personalize the dashboard with your name and your partner's name. 
- Conduct analysis to identify **three** locations or neighborhoods you want to visit. Use Google to figure out what might be interesting about those spots, but your commentary should show how your analysis supports your findings. 
- At the end of the hour, you will upload `dashboard.html` at the provided link.
