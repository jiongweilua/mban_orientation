I love to enhance the guest  experience.  Perhaps that’s why I’ve been a “Super Host” for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won’t be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I’m curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don’t jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can’t wait to meet you!!

I love to enhance the guest  experience.  Perhaps that’s why I’ve been a “Super Host” for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won’t be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I’m curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don’t jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can’t wait to meet you!!

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Chinatown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35055,-71.06169,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,5,1,2,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox}",NA,294,NA,NA,$100.00,$69.00,4,$15.00,2,1124,2,2,1124,1124,2,1124,2 days ago,TRUE,6,32,57,324,2019-07-14,180,36,2015-11-02,2019-06-23,93,9,9,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,4,882,1,1

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Chinatown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35148,-71.06077,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,1,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox,""Private entrance"",""Pack ’n Play/travel crib"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Long term stays allowed""}",NA,221,NA,NA,$199.00,$69.00,2,$15.00,2,1125,2,2,1125,1125,2,1125,2 days ago,TRUE,27,57,87,267,2019-07-14,11,11,2019-04-09,2019-06-29,91,9,9,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,3.4,663,1,1
