I love to enhance the guest  experience.  Perhaps that’s why I’ve been a “Super Host” for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won’t be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I’m curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don’t jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can’t wait to meet you!!

Phyllis

I love to enhance the guest  experience.  Perhaps that’s why I’ve been a “Super Host” for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won’t be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I’m curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don’t jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can’t wait to meet you!!

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off",It's walking distance (10 mins) from a green-line (B) subway T stop that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge.

As your arrival date nears, 1 day prior, you will be sent a message with instructions for electronic keycode access. Check in time is 3pm, and check out time is 12pm - that gives us a 3 hour window to have my cleaning crew fully clean, disinfect, change sheets, for your arrival and the guest coming in after you. You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11am check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, we may have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for our cleaning people to do the same. Unlike a hotel that has multiple rooms to shuffle around, I just have this one.","This is a fully contained private apartment so there is no need for direct interaction with guests, though we do like to meet you and you will see us around the building doing maintenance, etc.. You may call/text/email through here anytime as well. Before you arrive and after you leave, our cleaning crew will come in to clean and disinfect everything, replace all the sheets with newly clean ones. Please remember that check in time is 3pm and check out is 11am - this is important because we often have guests check in/out on the same days, back-to-back.","PLEASE close the front lobby door behind you after you enter and when you leave each time. It's a new door and it doesn't always latch on its own. PLEASE remove your shoes inside, and no smoking inside or nearby outside (because it drifts in) please.

Home to many Boston University and Boston College students, young professionals, and families, Brighton offers numerous pubs and ethnic restaurants, with many affordable options for a leisurely afternoon or a night out on the town. First settled by Europeans in 1630, the area was originally part of Watertown. In 1634, the Massachusetts Bay Colony transferred the land to Newtowne (Cambridge today). The first permanent English settlement in what is now Brighton drew people from Cambridge, and the area became known as “Little Cambridge.” The moniker lasted until residents voted to secede from Cambridge in 1807, when the area was renamed for the English coastal city of Brighton and Hove. In 1874, Brighton officially became a neighborhood of the city of Boston. Throughout its nearly 400-year history, Brighton has seen many important developments.

Or choose your favorite ingredients to stuff a personalized calzone. Brick House also serves salads, subs, wraps, dinner specials, and burgers.

3 things I cannot live without:

-My phone: Unfortunately (fortunately?) I fully embrace being connected, I love social media because I have friends all across the world, and it helps me stay in touch with people I care about.

-A good book (or 5) I'm currently reading: I like being immersed in a book. Lately, I've been reading a lot of non-fiction, but I love a good fantasy book to lose myself within.

-A good pair of headphones: I've been listening to a lot of podcasts lately, especially while I'm doing work that might be a little more tedious, or when I'm driving. 

My style of traveling: I'm not a huge planner; while traveling I like to plan for one thing to do per day, and just go wander for the rest of the day. Food is essential; it doesn't have to be fancy, but I love experiencing authentic local food and drinks",within an hour,100%,N/A,TRUE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f1ab6e23-ea75-43d8-bb5c-954781103c35.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/f1ab6e23-ea75-43d8-bb5c-954781103c35.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Allston-Brighton,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,FALSE,"Boston, MA, United States",Allston-Brighton,Allston,NA,Boston,MA,02134,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.34811,-71.13185,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,2,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",""Smoking allowed"",Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox,""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Wide hallways"",""Wide entrance for guests"",""No stairs or steps to enter"",""Wide entrance"",""Extra space around bed"",""Accessible-height bed"",""No stairs or steps to enter"",""Accessible-height toilet"",""No stairs or steps to enter"",""Wide entryway"",""Handheld shower head""}",NA,$85.00,NA,NA,$0.00,$45.00,4,$25.00,2,220,2,26,220,220,21.3,220,2 weeks ago,TRUE,4,4,4,188,2019-07-14,75,61,2018-04-29,2019-06-26,95,10,9,10,10,10,10,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,strict_14_with_grace_period,FALSE,FALSE,1,1,0,0,5.09
