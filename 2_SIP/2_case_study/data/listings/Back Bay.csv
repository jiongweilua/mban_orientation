Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.

In a nutshell: I'm a traveller, researcher, musician, fairly accomplished programmer, avid skier, and a general lover of life and everything to do with it.

In a slightly larger nutshell: I'm Petar. I was born in Cambridge, MA but moved back to Serbia a few months later. Lived there until 1999 when we moved back to the United States. I consider myself very lucky to be a child of two continents - this has allowed me to travel most of the world, and have fantastic times experiencing all of the different cultures, histories, and adventures that our little planet has to offer. I decided to join up on here as I wanted to expand my traveling network, and travel all over the world! For those who stay at my place - I know the Boston area in and out, and would be more than glad to show you what this fantastic city has to offer, and provide great accommodation. 

I'm a collector of memories, not things :)

Why I’m on AirBnB

The world is truly full of amazing people. When I'm not traveling, I'm happy to put up my place - I find it's a great way to travel, meet exceptional people and have fantastic experiences.

Interests

Many of my friends have described me as a renaissance man. If something interests me, I'll usually go out of my way to try it out. Currently, I've been on a bit of a language learning streak - I'm trying to get my German, French, and Italian to fairly passable levels. Thank God my Spanish is up to par!

Other than that, I've become quite interested in Art Deco architecture, and designs from that era. Can anyone say Bahaus?

Professionally, I'm a computer programmer, and a researcher in high performance computing. In this regard my interests, which probably bore pretty much everyone else have to do with efficient memory and cache, multithreaded program design, and all that other fun stuff.",within an hour,100%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3a56eef9-c138-470a-8d3e-2ec584715246.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3a56eef9-c138-470a-8d3e-2ec584715246.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Back Bay,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'jumio', 'government_id']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Back Bay,Back Bay,NA,Boston,MA,02116,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.3489,-71.08122,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,3,1,1,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",Essentials,""Laptop friendly workspace"",Bathtub,""Window guards"",""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Well-lit path to entrance"",""No stairs or steps to enter"",""No stairs or steps to enter""}",NA,$310.00,NA,NA,$500.00,$50.00,2,$30.00,2,5,2,2,5,5,2,5,4 weeks ago,TRUE,0,0,1,1,2019-07-14,2,2,2019-04-01,2019-04-15,100,10,7,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,flexible,FALSE,FALSE,1,1,0,0,0.57

We offer an experience that is truly one-of-a-kind, a place where you can enjoy a richly textured and profoundly memorable taste of the real Boston.

Following a landmark renovation, our hotel, Boston Park Plaza offers guests all the charisma and deeply individual charm of a historic hotel with the effortless comforts of a new one. Once again a destination unto itself, our hotel offers incomparable proximity to everything that makes Boston a treasured destination. We are one of the most sought-after hotels near Boston Common and enjoy an ideal location among the hotels in downtown Boston, just steps away from the Public Garden, Theater District and many of the city’s most popular historical sites.

When you’re looking for the best hotel, Boston Park Plaza provides an unrivaled legacy of service.

We offer an experience that is truly one-of-a-kind, a place where you can enjoy a richly textured and profoundly memorable taste of the real Boston.

Following a landmark renovation, our hotel, Boston Park Plaza offers guests all the charisma and deeply individual charm of a historic hotel with the effortless comforts of a new one. Once again a destination unto itself, our hotel offers incomparable proximity to everything that makes Boston a treasured destination. We are one of the most sought-after hotels near Boston Common and enjoy an ideal location among the hotels in downtown Boston, just steps away from the Public Garden, Theater District and many of the city’s most popular historical sites.

When you’re looking for the best hotel, Boston Park Plaza provides an unrivaled legacy of service. When Boston Park Plaza opened in 1927, it redefined a standard of hospitality that guests came to expect. With our history of innovation and continued dedication to our guests, we are proud to be recognized as Boston’s Most Beloved.

Following a landmark renovation, our hotel, Boston Park Plaza offers guests all the charisma and deeply individual charm of a historic hotel with the effortless comforts of a new one. Once again a destination unto itself, our hotel offers incomparable proximity to everything that makes Boston a treasured destination. We are one of the most sought-after hotels near Boston Common and enjoy an ideal location among the hotels in downtown Boston, just steps away from the Public Garden, Theater District and many of the city’s most popular historical sites.

When you’re looking for the best hotel, Boston Park Plaza provides an unrivaled legacy of service. When Boston Park Plaza opened in 1927, it redefined a standard of hospitality that guests came to expect. With our history of innovation and continued dedication to our guests, we are proud to be recognized as Boston’s Most Beloved.
