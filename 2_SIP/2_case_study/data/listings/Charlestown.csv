I am an enthusiastic host, yoga teacher and healthcare professional. After living in Boston for 12 years and thoroughly enjoying the city and all it has to offer, I thought it would be fun to open my home up to guests through Airbnb--after all, I loved having friends come to visit me. 

Whether you are traveling to Boston for business or research work, for a sports game, or to see the plentiful sights, I am happy to host you. There are tons of truly unique and fun activities to do around town; or if you like, you can ""live like a local"".

Between the two of us, we've lived in all the greater neighborhoods of Boston at least once and we've chosen to settle down in Charlestown. We love to travel, try new things and enjoy exploring unknown cities without a guide - the best way to get a feel for what the locals do with their down time.

We travel often to visit family and friends in other states so our home is often left empty. We would love for others to get to experience Charlestown like we do every day. We love the historic atmosphere, our friendly neighborhood, the vibrant community and the easy access to downtown Boston as well as tons of local restaurants and bars.

Charlestown is a great spot to stay while in Boston - charming, historic, walkable to all points of interest, family-friendly and close to the water.
