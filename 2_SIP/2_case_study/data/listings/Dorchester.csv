In winter we help eachother with shoveling snow; people stay a long time, as it is a pleasant place to live.","We have extra guitars and other acoustic instruments; also games and fun books, some in Italian, French or Spanish, to relax with after a long day (including Asterix!).

Walk or bike to several beaches and bike trails (we can rent you some bikes!), or take a quick subway ride to see the historic Boston center or visit the cultural and academic areas of Boston.

I'm from Dublin, Ireland and moved to Boston 6 years ago. 

Loved to travel around Europe and always enjoyed the hostels we stayed in! After moving to the states I have tended to remain up here in the North East, travelling around Massachusetts to New Hampshire up to Canada - generally on the hunt for good skiing.

While in Boston I try to balance things out between working away as a code monkey and trying to pull together a startup. With a few hours still going to waste, I've gone back to school with evening classes up in Harvard Extension. 

I love having friends over - I'll throw together some random event, be it Johnny Appleseed Cider Fest or a Spaceballs movie night. Something to get friends together.

I have good taste and adore creature comforts. My style is neatness, art, and books with a judicious dash of knickknack. I have a thing for fluffy towels, so you will have a good supply!  I love flowers, so you may see an efflorescence of fresh color here and there. And, most important, I love excellent coffee. So don't worry, here in this corner of America, there will be excellent single origin coffee ;-) 

I know the city well.  With me, no best-kept secret is safe. I can tell you about some little known places of interest and some great restaurants. I can also tell you things like where to go for a great view, where to go if it's raining, and where to go for the best hot chocolate. Thank you for checking out my listing. I look forward to welcoming you into my lovely Victorian home and helping you with your visit to Boston!

I live and work here, and enjoy meeting new people. It's like having old friends visit, not like a hotel. You are welcome to make yourself at home in the common living areas and to use the kitchen, but please leave everything as clean as you found it and put everything back where you found it. As we will be sharing a bathroom, I appreciate your tidying up and keeping personal items in your room. The cat is not allowed outdoors – he can be sneaky so please don’t leave doors open and keep an eye out for him. I am environmentally friendly and appreciate you being mindful as well.  Thank you for being considerate and for treating the home as you would yours.  Please turn off lights, fans (or AC or heaters when available) when not in the bedroom.  Always lock the doors and make sure Pooch the cat doesn't sneak out.  And, always, please be kind, friendly, clean and considerate.

I have a beautiful inviting apartment around the corner from the red line in Boston and would love to welcome you during your holiday, relocation or visit. I also have a new home in Providence I am constantly updating. When not in Boston or Providence, I can be found on photo assignments all around New England. When not on assignments, decorating or hosting, I may be found roaming the four corners of the world. My favorite part of the world is South East Asia (I've spent multiple Winters in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, China, Myanmar, India, The Philippines and Indonesia to name a few ;)) and more recent trips have taken me to Guadeloupe, Panama, Colombia and various other Central and South American countries. I speak French, Spanish and English mostly and understand a few other languages; I love roaming the world, discovering new cultures and meeting new people. I started hosting on Airbnb in April 2016 and I am loving it and loving the privilege of hosting people from around the world!

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late. It's all up to me.",within an hour,100%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/27d85b4c-76cf-47c7-b7dc-0003b011f647.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/27d85b4c-76cf-47c7-b7dc-0003b011f647.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Cambridge,18,18,"['email', 'phone', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Dorchester,Dorchester,NA,Boston,MA,02124,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.28112,-71.06534,TRUE,House,Private room,4,2.5,1,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Keypad,Bathtub,""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",Microwave,Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",Oven,Stove,""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Paid parking on premises""}",NA,$40.00,NA,NA,$0.00,$20.00,1,$15.00,1,1125,1,1,1125,1125,1,1125,today,TRUE,15,45,75,165,2019-07-14,77,39,2017-09-04,2019-06-29,88,9,9,9,9,9,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,strict_14_with_grace_period,FALSE,FALSE,10,0,10,0,3.4

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late. It's all up to me.",within an hour,100%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/27d85b4c-76cf-47c7-b7dc-0003b011f647.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/27d85b4c-76cf-47c7-b7dc-0003b011f647.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Cambridge,18,18,"['email', 'phone', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Dorchester,Dorchester,NA,Boston,MA,02124,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.28337,-71.065,TRUE,House,Private room,2,2.5,1,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Heating,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Keypad,Bathtub,""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",Microwave,Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Garden or backyard"",""Luggage dropoff allowed"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Paid parking on premises""}",NA,$40.00,NA,NA,$0.00,$20.00,1,$15.00,1,1125,1,1,1125,1125,1,1125,today,TRUE,13,24,27,302,2019-07-14,84,37,2017-09-04,2019-06-16,87,9,9,9,9,9,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,strict_14_with_grace_period,FALSE,FALSE,10,0,10,0,3.71

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

My husband and I mostly use Air BNB to 'get away', even just to leave town to go nowhere in particular.  We have had some of our best times together in Maine or Vermont in others' beautiful country homes.  I plan detailed, time-efficient and creative itineraries for us to enjoy everything that areas have to offer.  We especially enjoy the very local dive places, farm tours,  and wineries.  My husband is easygoing, fun, adventurous, and the most loyal, kind friend anyone could ever imagine.  I am very lucky.  

I rent a place out on air bnb and rent from others.  I'm an excellent guest and host. :)

Thanks for checking out my properties!  

My name is Dawn and I have been living in beautiful historical Charlestown for the last 16 years. My property is near and dear to my heart as this was my grandparents home that I pretty much grew up in and that I bought after they passed away. I recently decided to turn my beautiful peice of property into a place where visitors can come and enjoy all this wonderful city has to offer while staying in a place of history vs a hotel!  You will enjoy staying here and all this city has to offer_ I will make sure of it!  :)

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

I always love the adventure of travel – the unknown, something different, something new.  I have been extremely lucky to continuously feed my passion for travel. 

I love the excitement of it all–feeling like an explorer–discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don't live for the future or the past… just in the moment. 

I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land that I hadn't planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. 

I love the logistics. I like landing in a new place and trying to figure it all out myself. Where to get money. How to speak the language. How to go from point A to point B. How to pack my bag right so I don't go insane after packing it for the 135th time. 

I love meeting new people all the time. In no other time in my life have I met so many people and made so many new friends in such a short time.  The world is full of friendly, generous people. 

I love the freedom. I experience a great feeling of independence from traveling. I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I can sleep in. I can stay out late.

We are Romo and Nayeli - a young married couple living in Boston.

We are both originally from Texas, but met and got married in China. We both love to travel and are always planning new adventures.  Anywhere we go, we are always seeking for the latest culinary experience or that perfect balanced cocktail from a local bar tender.

Right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We truly believe that hospitality is the art of making others feel welcome, comfortable, and at home.  It's the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always.  
 
Now, we have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand, spent time studying in Spain before moving to Beijing  in 2000 after graduating.  

Nayeli and I met in Shenzhen, China in 2010 and in 2015 we tied the knot in the great city of Shanghai.  Shortly thereafter, In 2016, we decided to repatriate back to the US after 16 years of living and working abroad.

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  We are now both very happy to be back in the US, and even more so when we get the opportunity to call Boston home.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

The red line also goes to Cambridge and Somerville.","There may be other Airbnb guests in the first-floor apartment. We have two dogs (about 50 pounds and about 70 pounds). They are both friendly, but our younger, large, white dog is excitable and sometimes barks...very occasionally he has been known to bark at guests, but he's not aggressive, just a scaredy cat dumb-dumb.","We're conveniently near the MBTA red line, on a bus route, and minutes from the highway (Rte. 93).

There will be other Airbnb guests on the first floor, and we live on the ground/garden level with our two dogs. We use the backyard space, but you'll have access to two second-floor porches (one with shade and one with sun).","We are in the garden level in-law suite this summer, so we are available if anything is needed, but we tend to let guests do their own thing.",We ask for quiet after 10 pm on weekdays and 11 pm on weekends. We also ask for relative quiet prior to 9 am on weekdays and 10 am on weekends.
