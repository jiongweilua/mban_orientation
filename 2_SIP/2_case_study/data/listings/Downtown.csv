If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Chinatown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35055,-71.06169,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,5,1,2,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox}",NA,$294.00,NA,NA,$100.00,$69.00,4,$15.00,2,1124,2,2,1124,1124,2,1124,2 days ago,TRUE,6,32,57,324,2019-07-14,180,36,2015-11-02,2019-06-23,93,9,9,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,4

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Downtown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35541,-71.06136,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,1,3,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Elevator,Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",""Building staff""}",NA,$203.00,NA,NA,$150.00,$69.00,2,$15.00,2,1124,2,2,1124,1124,2,1124,2 days ago,TRUE,8,24,24,24,2019-07-14,127,40,2016-09-15,2019-06-25,92,9,9,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,3.69

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Chinatown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35172,-71.05993,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,1,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox,""Private entrance"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove}",NA,$189.00,NA,NA,$199.00,$69.00,2,$15.00,2,1125,2,2,1125,1125,2,1125,2 days ago,TRUE,16,46,76,256,2019-07-14,5,5,2019-04-07,2019-06-22,80,9,10,10,9,8,8,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,1.52

Thanks for looking into my profile . My name is Hasan. I work for a financial technology firm as a head of business development. As a side gig, I have been an airbnb host for 3 years managing 8 units in Boston and Cambridge. 

As you may have already seen, hotel prices are insanely expensive in Boston.  Thankfully, we are still able to offer affordable stays for those who are on a tight budget for their travel despite the fact that the city and hotel lobbies are cracking down on airbnb.

Why Do I host?
 I love the fact that people can still find affordable stays through Airbnb. When a family of 4 visits their daughter in May for graduation, they can book a place for $250/night instead of paying over $1000/night for a hotel stay. It means a lot to me! ( there was a time my parents could not come from overseas to visit me just because we could not afford their stay! ) 

My priority is to provide well located affordable stays to families and business travelers. I guarantee you that you will find a clean, well designed and conveniently located units with 24/7 assistance . 

However, if you have high standards, luxury buildings or jacuzzi tubs in the unit, my apartments may not be best option for you: Considering over $4000/month rents for a rundown building in Boston, I am not able to afford high end buildings to host guests on airbnb. You shall look for different options for your satisfactions. 

For others, I am more than happy to host you! Let's keep this community happy

Regards,
Hasan",within an hour,92%,N/A,FALSE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfc6e70b-7963-4dc9-8693-4764d22c7e25.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Chinatown,7,7,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",TRUE,TRUE,"Boston, MA, United States",Downtown,Chinatown,NA,Boston,MA,02111,Boston,"Boston, MA",US,United States,42.35148,-71.06077,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,1,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",Elevator,Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",Lockbox,""Private entrance"",""Pack ’n Play/travel crib"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Long term stays allowed""}",NA,$221.00,NA,NA,$199.00,$69.00,2,$15.00,2,1125,2,2,1125,1125,2,1125,2 days ago,TRUE,27,57,87,267,2019-07-14,11,11,2019-04-09,2019-06-29,91,9,9,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,"{""Massachusetts State"","" Massachusetts State""}",TRUE,FALSE,moderate,FALSE,FALSE,5,5,0,0,3.4
