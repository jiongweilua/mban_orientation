I grew up in New York City in a wonderful family oriented community.  I then attended University in Arizona where I obtained an Industrial Engineering degree. I worked for Philips Semiconductors as an engineer in Arizona for 10 years where I also owned and managed my own rental properties. I was then offered to live and work in Europe as an engineer, which I really enjoyed for 3 years. Since settling in the Boston area I have been purchasing homes, renovating them and converting them into condos. 

I have a passion for both children and animals and my husband and I have spent many years as foster parents in Cambridge for the State of Massachusetts.  I am currently training my 8 year old yellow lab Sadie to work with a pet program that visits elders and adults with disabilities in local hospitals in and around Boston.

I'm a news junkie, foodie and love reading. I was born and raised in Orlando, but moved to Boston 6 years ago. I absolutely love Boston and all it has to offer. From the culture, great culinary treats, to the many open spaces and historic sites. My second home is Fort Lauderdale and Vieques, PR. Can you say warm weather! 

I spend most of my day responding and answering guest inquiries and insuring guests have a pleasant stay. Does your Airbnb take up too much of your time? Want to put it on autopilot? Shoot me a message, I would love to help :)

Feel free to reach out with any questions. I try to respond as quickly as time allows and am always available for my guests!

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

Come stay here now; try out and tell your friends about the mom and pop places you enjoyed in the neighborhood.","This is my old flat.  I've used my furnishings to set up this Airbnb.  It's a great place to be based for a Boston trip, but some reviews I've received are based on an expectation of a 5-star hotel.  This Airbnb offers a great value with short travel times into the heart of the city, but it is not a luxury flat; true Airbnb'ers will love it! If you have question about the flat before or after you book please reach out and I will happily answer them. East Boston has a lot of character, and I encourage guests to explore the area around the flat as well as downtown Boston, which is less than 15 minutes away by subway and less than 5 minutes away by car.","As Eastie may not be the reason you're visiting Boston, this location offers easy access to the more touristy neighborhoods of Boston. PARKING: Also the flat does not include a private driveway.  In the evening and weekends, or for two hour periods of time, you can park on the street.  Make sure to obey the posted signs.   For garage parking the closest lot I'm aware of is the economy airport parking lot.  It's about $18/day, and about a 10 minute walk (walk to and through the airport subway stop using the stairs) or short Uber/can ride from the flat.

FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION Take the free airport shuttle bus to the Airport Subway Station which is on the Blue Line.  These free shuttle buses run every 5-6 minutes and can be found curbside on the lower level of each terminal.  The buses are blue and white-- make sure that the shuttle bus you take will stop at the Airport Subway station (most do, but a few only provide service between terminals).  DO NOT take the Silver Line from the airport as this will take you to downtown Boston, not to our house. Once at the Airport Station (subway line), you will need to buy a Charlie Ticket at the ticket machines in the station lobby.  The cost is $2.75 for 1 ride.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

A family Italian bread bakery makes fresh bread daily starting at 5 AM almost across the street every day except Sunday.  If you come often it is convenient to learn how to walk here from the airport car rental terminal (about ten minutes walk from free Airport shuttle to the car rental counters) - so when you land at the airport, you are ""home""!  The skyline views from Piers Park are the best in Boston. Nearby Maverick subway is only one stop from the heart of downtown Boston and one stop from the airport.   Other nearby restaurants include Cunard Tavern, Maverick Marketplace Cafe, and The Reel House (with amazing views).  About 1 mile away are",You will love the area.  Perfect blend of peaceful neighborhood with proximity to everything the city offers.,"Very close to MBTA ""T"" (Blue line), Maverick (and Airport) Station.  City bicycle rental kiosks are also available nearby.  If you want an occasional car then the airport rental center is about a ten minute walk or take Uber or call Enterprise.

If we are in town we will greet you personally We are just far enough down Jeffries Point  penninsula (as close to a cul de sac as you will find in the city - there is only one way in and out and no through traffic) for being relatively quiet while in the city, yet still very close to the subway, shops, parks, restaurants, cider brewery, art museum, etc.","Understand this is our personal home and it will be a very nice place to stay, though we don't aim for complete perfection (i.e. everything will be great but if you go on a hint you may could find an aberrant dust bunny - just want to set reasonable expectations!).  We leave the home FULLY STOCKED with everything you could possibly need, INCLUDING FOOD - please replace what you use or agree to compensate Boston prices (high) and a small fee if you can't replace everything.  ""Vine and Barley"" local wine, beer, and liquor store less than 2 minute walk from here as are several other convenience stores.  Shaw's Supermarket 1 mile/10-15 minutes walk if you need a lot of things - or if you stay more than a week and want to eat a lot in-house then I will tell you how to easily get to Market Basket (much cheaper) or Whole Foods, Chinatown, and/or Trader Joe's.
