I like to refer to myself as a retired elementary teacher although I spent the last quarter of my career as an administrator.  But my teaching years were my best.  The daily student teacher interaction, the laughter and frustrations, the little signs of progress, made the work so fulfilling.

I grew up on a very successful produce and dairy farm in Southeastern Massachusetts.  Our main cash crop was tomatoes but we raised all kinds of vegetables.  They were trucked into Boston.  In the winter the dairy supported us.  My childhood exposed me to hard work but also to a love for the outdoors and nature.

Out of college I worked for the Department of Defense as a teacher in their overseas dependents' schools.  I taught in Istanbul and Seville, Spain.  I was able to travel extensively through Europe for three years.

Upon returning to the States I began teaching in Quincy, Massachusetts, where I remained for thirty years.  The last seven years were spent as a principal of an elementary school which has a majority population of Asian students.  I traveled to China one summer to explore my students' heritage and culture.

In the interim I married Joyce Brothers.  Joyce is a case manager for Boston Senior Home Care.  Her passion is cooking and she is a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts.

She and I have raised two children.  Our daughter is a school teacher.  Our son, born in Brazil, is a hair stylist.

As a life-long learner I am a proponent of travel.

If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.
