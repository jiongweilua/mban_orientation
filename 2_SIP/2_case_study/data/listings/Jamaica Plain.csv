I've trekked France, I've studied Spanish in Madrid, I've tossed bread crumbs to fish in Greece. 

Come to Boston, and I'll do everything I can to make sure you make wonderful new travel memories here, dining under my grape arbor, visiting your children's college, walking the Freedom Trail or whatever else you wind up doing!

We have lived all over Boston but have always considered Jamaica Plain the best neighborhood in town... partly because it is a true neighborhood. Nowhere else in the city can you be 5-minutes from dense nature that obscures the hustle and bustle of urban life by Jamaica Pond or the Arboretum, while still being minutes from Fenway Park, Longwood medical center, and great restaurants!

We have two sons, 13 & 12, and we love to avail ourselves of the city and community we love. We coach baseball, basketball, and flag football, and love to explore, meet new people, and share what we know about Boston with anyone interested. 

For many years we hosted international students coming to Boston to study English and have hosted folks from Korea, Japan, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Kazakhstan. These former guests are now good friends and we enjoyed being their ambassadors to Boston.

Delicious coffee can be found in a number of different places where you can lounge comfortably and people watch or work. JP is a speci",This is on the third floor so not a great choice for people with enormous luggage! Please ask if you intend to have anyone visit while you stay with us. Please go easy on the heat! We have a very economical ductless mini-split heat/ac system for the large space but there's electric baseboard in the bedroom and bathroom which is very expensive to run. We like to be kind to the environment and we ask you to do the same and be mindful of the extra expense to us if you don't use it sparingly. The small print: the bathroom is large but there isn't a lot of headroom in the center of the room. The strategically placed skylight insures that those who stand to go to the bathroom can do so without crouching but the headroom over the tiny sink is not great. Anyone over 6' will have to bend a bit in that one area. We lifted the roof for the oversize shower so that's not a problem.,You can park in our driveway except in the winter but there's always plenty of free parking on our street: no need for a sticker or permit. We are a few blocks from the bus to the medical area and Back Bay Station. We're a 15 minute walk to the Orange Line T (Forest Hills or Green Street) which will connect you with all of Boston and/or Cambridge. It's also a very walkable part of town! We're close to the Longwood Medical area; some of our neighbors who work there walk or bike to work.,You have the entire 3rd floor to yourselves! We renovated the attic following all the City of Boston Building Codes. You have a separate entrance from the back porch and do not have to go through our living space to get to yours. You can park in our driveway in every season but winter when we use the parking space. There are always many parking spaces open on our street which is completely uncharacteristic for most of Jamaica Plain and Boston. No permit required.,We'll be around a lot of the time to help with recommendations or anything else you might need and I'm always reachable by phone. I'm friendly and helpful by nature but will respect your need for privacy and space if you so desire.,"- No shoes in the apartment. - No candles, smoking or open flames. - Eat only at the kitchen table. - No drugs or heavy drinking. - Please check with us if you plan on having guests. - Clean up after yourself: do your dishes and wipe the table and countertops after you cook or eat. Please be respectful of our things. We renovated this space especially for Airbnb guests but we love it up there. We put some of our nicest furniture and rugs in it. We live in the apartment on the 2nd floor and go to bed by 9:30. Please be mindful that this is a pretty quiet house and we'd like to keep it that way. We have a poodle who sometimes barks when people walk by.",NA,NA,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/51d981cb-a7bf-4537-8dc2-11c058e8717b.jpg?aki_policy=large,NA,30593609,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/30593609,Jennifer,2015-04-04,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","I'm a photographer specializing in portraits.

I am Joanna, a current candidate in a Master’s program in Sustainable International Development at Brandeis! As a student in an international program, I truly value traveling in addition to music and other hobbies involving exploring the world. I believe Airbnb is a great platform for anyone who wants to travel and enjoys visiting different places and cultures! 
 
I've lived in Spain, grew up in North Carolina, and now consider myself a Bostonian. My home in South Boston is very comfortable and right next the beach where I enjoy jogging in the mornings! I would like to share my place while I'm Airbnbing since I believe my home will bring happiness and a true Boston experience :) 
 
When I'm not traveling or studying, I enjoy nonfiction books such as ""A New Earth Awakening"" By Eckhart Tolle or simply relaxing at the beach near Castle Island. 
 
As a host, I will do my best to provide you with a very comfortable stay in my home and provide with the very best tips for visiting Boston. As a guest, I will respect your home and truly appreciate the space given to me.
