There are immigrants from Jamaica, Haiti,  and Sierra Leone to name a few, and the atmosphere is family-centric with lots of children out playing in their yards and at the nearby playgrounds. Though there is a very occasional backyard gathering that will produce a jovial scene that some might find to be a noisy disturbance, most people find the neighborhood to be surprisingly tranquil and relaxing in the evenings.","When I am home, I have a dog that lives with me on the premises.

There are two options from South Station in Boston, which is the main train and bus terminal and the destination of the free Silver Line bus shuttle from Logan Airport. You can either take the Red Line to Ashmont Station, and then transfer to the Mattapan Trolley and ride it to Mattapan Square, or you can take the MBTA Commuter Rail train to Morton St. (Fairmount Line). It's about a 12-15 minute walk from either one of these stations to the house. The cost of these two trains is about the same - approximately $2.50 per person one way - and while the Commuter Rail trains are more expeditious, the Red Line trains run more frequently than do the Commuter Rail trains. There are also city bus stops very close by. Visit the Boston MBTA website for all bus and train schedule and fee information.","The entire home is available for your use.
