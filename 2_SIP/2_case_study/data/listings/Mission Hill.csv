Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

I traveled back and forth to Boston during the mid-80's and 90's. I'm the founder of a non-profit organization here in Boston called, ""Bikes Not Bombs"" (BNB) where i worked for 25 years coordinating the international work as well as helping to start the inner city youth programs here in Boston and a bike shop which BNB currently operates.  Twenty years ago, my partner, Cecilia, and I started to create a family, we have one 19 year old son named Ziggy. Cecilia is from Argentina and we are all bi-lingual Spanish and English speaking. Cecilia is currently working as a case manager for a live-at-home elderly services and support organization. In 2010 my family and I traveled by public busses for two years, homeschooling our son and witnessing life in nine South and Central American countries. We started the trip by car camping across the USA for 3 months, then selling the car, flying to Buenos Aires and slowly returning over land by bus, boat, and train, on two occasions we also did WOOFING on family farms.   
I'm currently doing carpentry and handyman work, but because of some issues with pinched nerves i'm looking to find more ways to make a living including airbnb.  I love traveling, bird watching, hiking in nature, fishing, books, cooking, art, bike riding and sustainable organic gardening among other things. I tend our 30' by 60' garden and grape arbor which makes our house exceptionally nice from May to November.

When you walk out our back door, you’ll be greeted with a forest of trees, rose bushes, and the song of birds. A short walk through the forest path brings you to a large grassy field (from which you can see the ocean!), basketball courts, a playground, and baseball fields. In the late summer and early fall, you’ll find a wide variety of apples to pick from the trees and munch on as you walk to the orange line. In the winter, the park offers some great spots for sledding (we can provide a sled, or you can get creative). There are a few grocery stores (Stop and Shop and Whole Foods) and cafes within a 20 minute walk. For dinner, there are many restaurants in Brookline Village, Brigham Circle, and Hyde Square, all within walking distance.","We are happy to host kids in our house.

We both like traveling and visiting different places and meeting new people. During several of our trips we have used airbnb for our lodging and have met many great people. So we just recently decided to also open up our home and become a host for airbnb. 
As airbnb guests we enjoyed staying at nice clean rooms that allowed for some privacy. Our goal is to provide the same expectations for our guests when we host.

This past year, I was fortunate to have the opportunity (and time!) to visit a number of different places--- I roadtripped around Bend, OR and along the coast of CA, went to Burning Man for the first time, and spent time with friends in Ethiopia, India, Iceland, Croatia, and Greece. I had amazing airbnb experiences throughout and am looking forward to welcoming others to my home now as a host! Outside of traveling and medicine, I also enjoy photography, biking, finding new hobbies (currently trying to tackle the unicycle-- tips appreciated), and just general romping around town.
