This apartment is on Ardale Street, a quiet side street off Centre Street.  Within a block of my apartment are a convenience store, pizza parlor, sports bar and grill, dry cleaner, diner for breakfast and lunch, gas station and a small gym. I am located about one-half mile from Faulkner Hospital, within walking distance to the renowned Arnold Arboretum park, and about 20-minute drive to Boston's Longwood Medical Center area. I have easy, restriction-free, on-street parking here, and a spacious, peaceful back yard. About one-half mile away is Roslindale Square, with banks, post office, many small bakeries, food shops and restaurants.","There is no smoking allowed, inside the apartment or outside. This is different from a hotel in the sense that i like to know when my guests are leaving or returning. So, please stop to say hello or goodbye when you leave the apartment in the morning, or come back home in the evening.","PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: From the house, quick public transportation to Forest Hills station (Orange Line and Commuter Rail) is via two nearby MBTA bus lines. The #38 bus stops one-half block away, and takes you past the Faulkner, then to Jamaica Plain and Forest Hills.  The #51 bus stops two blocks away, and goes a more direct route to Forest Hills. (The bus also goes to Cleveland Circle in Brookline.) Between the two bus lines, there is a bus that stops here every 15 minutes or so on weekdays; but there is no service on Sunday.  ALSO, the apartment is just 1/2 mile walk to the ""Roslindale Village"" MBTA commuter rail stop, Needham Line. The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.  There are more city busses, running 7 days a week, from this MBTA rail station. You can also pick up ZIP Cars there.  Many of my guests also use Uber to get them around, too. GETTING HERE FROM LOGAN AIRPORT","You can have access to your room, the adjacent bathroom, the full kitchen and all my cooking appliances and utensils. You can relax in the living room, watch Netflix or HBO on my flat-screen TV. You can also spend as much time as you want in the peaceful back yard, where there is a summer garden and lawn chairs to sit in.","ABOUT ME: I am one of the original Boston AIRBNB hosts, having signed-up with them in 2008.   I am a big traveler myself, and I love hearing stories of where guests have been or where they are heading to next.   Here are clues to my personality:  Favorite singers are Judy Collins, Ari Hest, Spanish vocalist Miguel Bose and the British rock band, James.  My top favorite places to travel to are Oaxaca, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary. In years gone by, I have had repeated trips to Paris, Naples,  and to Tunisia, also. I'm a laid-back, friendly, single guy. I work from home, spending a lot of time on the computer. My website where I sell handmade things from Mexico is called ""Viva Oaxaca Folk Art."" You will see lots of folk art in the apartment.  Since I work from home, I will be here to answer questions and provide directions and occasionally, a ride to the subway, if needed. I am very friendly and outgoing, but also tend to have a lot of work to attend to in my office. I don’t smoke, don’t","I require my guests to have a verified email address, and government-issued ID and recommendations from at least one other host, before booking.  I encourage you to use my kitchen and laundry facilities. Meals must be eaten in the kitchen, at the table. There is no additional charge to use the washer/dryer in the basement.  No smoking, inside or outside. If you are out at night, have fun and come home as late as you want.  If you come home stumbling drunk, it's OK the first time. If you do it again, though, the downstairs neighbors and I will start to be annoyed.

I have traveled frequently, in much of the world, especially central Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia. In recent years I have had many trips to Mexico, where I buy folk art for my online business, called Viva Oaxaca Folk Art. I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  

In addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. 

In the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called ""beta.hifi.archive"" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins.
