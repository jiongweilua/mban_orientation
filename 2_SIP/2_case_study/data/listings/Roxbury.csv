Thank you for checking out my profile! 
I am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of ""middle aged,"" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.

We have a progressive and engaged group of residents where one of the world's leading experts in urban farming resides, lots of public spaces, urban wilds (including our wild turkeys),","The studio is adjacent to a separate apartment next door, so please simply be considerate. The studio is located on the ground level of the building, up 4 steps off of the sidewalk, and though its a residential neighborhood, it's still the city so there will be general background city noise. Our area is considered safe and quiet for Boston, but this is the city, and anything can happen anywhere at any time so I always like to tell people to have common sense in travels in the whole city. We are walking distance to many good cafes, bars, restaurants down Tremont St past the T (metro station) and a ~$8 Uber ride to the day/nightlife of the Back Bay. 2nd & 3rd Guest Fee: $30/night/guest 3 Guests total maximum Cleaning Fee: $35","Logan Airport ✈:  Take an airport shuttle bus from your terminal to the Airport T subway station (blue line).

T (subway/metro)  : The station is Roxbury Crossing 5 mins walk away and it's the 3rd stop to Back Bay 5 mins ride. Another 3 more stops from there takes you to Downtown Crossing 10 mins ride. Blue Bikes sharing : $6 for a 24 hour pass or $12 for a 72 hour pass. I highly recommend this as a way to discover the city. Right at the T, subway station outside you'll see these bikes and the station is located on Boston's longest bike and walking path, the Southwest Corridor Park. 10 mins to Back Bay, 25 mins to Harvard Square.  Walk : 5-15 minutes walk to local restaurants, bars and grocery store. 15 minutes walking distance to Longwood Medical Area, Northeastern University, Museum of Fine Arts, etc and 25 minu","Bathroom, living room with pullout sofa bed, HD cable tv, kitchenette (microwave, electric kettle, tea, sugar, coffee, snacks & fridge), hair dryer, hangers, iron, iron board & fresh towels located in closet, and full sized bed.

I was born and raised in Boston, went to university literally down the road at Northeastern and so with plenty of knowledge I would be more than happy to help. I work from home and so usually around if you ever needed anything. My mother lives in a separate apartment (so please feel free to say hi if you cross paths with her outside) and I'm just next door.

I'm an international, global citizen who loves travel, food, cultures, languages, history, current events and much more.

I also spend time on issues I'm passionate on, one of which is education where I sit on the board of a school.

I also love hosting guests and giving them the best experience in my home that I look for when I travel all over on Airbnb. 

Fun fact: I studied Mandarin for 6 years and sadly forgot most of it, so I'd love to practice it with you if you speak it :)

I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 150 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a rising senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

I started on Airbnb with ""Gorgeous Cape Cod"" property in May 2015, listed our renovated ""Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated ""Beautiful Boston Brownstone"" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - ""Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 150 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a rising senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

I've lived here for two years, and have never felt unsafe in my area, even at night. My neighbors are all great. I grew up in Southern California, and I have lived in diverse, multi-cultural areas most of my life. However, because it is a lower income neighborhood, you will see things such as: run down buildings, occasional graffiti, and homeless people panhandling down Melnea Cass Blvd in the warmer months, mostly towards Massachusetts Ave. The building was built in 1899, and the windows need updating, so you will most likely hear noises such as: sirens, (the hospital and police station are both within close proximity,) and music and horns from the cars stopped at the traffic light out front. Occasionally you might hear: music from the unit below, people occasionally yelling outside, the doors closing","Please remember that this is home sharing! My house is clean - but lived in - it will not be like a hotel. There may be stacks of books, kids toys, and occasional other things you will see.  I can't relocate my stuff somewhere else, unfortunately, and sometimes putting something away means putting it neatly to the side. I have an indoor only cat in the house, so if you have allergies or dislike animals, this is probably not the place for you. Cats tend to shed quite a bit, so there will be cat hair, and he will probably want to be in the room with you. (Feel free to shut him out.) There is a litter box in a closet in the hall by the bathroom. If you are not a cat lover - or tolerant of animals - this is probably not the best place for you to stay. Occasionally cats can get sick or have accidents. I sweep constantly, but the cat hair never fully goes away. (Hardwood floors - it just floats around.) If my cat doesn't like how you treat him, or if you scare him, he may hiss or bat at you.","My apartment is an ideal commuter location! The I-93 is right up the road. Silver Line T Stop Melnea Cass @ Washington is a block away, and goes into downtown in about 20-25 minutes, and to the airport in about 40 minutes. Orange line T Stop Ruggles is a 15 minute walk, and can connect you to all other subway lines. Multiple bus stops one block away, including the #1 bus which will take you into Cambridge. Free, on-street parking is usually available, though it may be a little harder during peak workday hours. Zipcar lot right next to Haley House Café. Easy Uber drive into downtown is usually $6-$8 when not surging.","Two small but cozy bedrooms. The first has a full sized bed, the second is a child's room and has a twin bed.  Couch in the living room can also be used for sleeping. Small bathroom with bath and shower. Small kitchen with fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Please provide your own food - I will provide space in the fridge. There is no dishwasher, so please wash your own dishes. The hallway has three large bookshelves full of books - feel free to borrow as long as you return them in the same condition that you find them! Living room area is full of sun, and has a couch, two chairs, a flat screen TV, Amazon Prime and Netflix access and a Blu-ray player. I paint so there is a studio space with a desk in my living room. I respectfully ask that you keep away from the art/art supplies/paintings. Please note that there is no table and chairs for eating meals at.","I will leave the keys in a lockbox for you for check-in, and save the check-in instructions on Airbnb. I will email you the lockbox code and some information a day or two before you arrive. I am always available via Airbnb messaging for help, questions about the apartment, questions about getting around, as well as for any suggestions in the area. If for any reason I need to enter the apartment while you are there, I will let you know in advance, and check with you to make sure this is okay. If you are there longer than four days, someone will be by to check on and attend to the cats. You are not required to attend to the cats in any way.","BY MAKING THIS RESERVATION YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOLLOWING: 1) You will contact me with a check-in time before your arrival.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 150 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a rising senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

If you avoid morning and after work commutes, the rates are usually between $4 - $9, but can be more during surge periods. Taking public transportation from here will cost at least $1.70 per person in bus fare (if you have a Charlie Card, explained below) and usually involves a transfer (free), so it can be a little complicated for visitors and doesn't save you that much compared to UberPool or Lyft Line.   If you are planning on using public transportation while here, which can be a good idea when you are travelling between areas accessible by the T (our subway), we suggest that you get a Charlie Card. They are hard plastic cards that you can store value on and use to pay for T and bus fares. Additionally, the fares are discounted compared to paying cash or getting one time passes ($2.25 vs $2.75 for the T, $1.70 vs. $2.00 for bus). You can pick up a Charlie Card at any major T stop.

If you suspect you'll feel uncomfortable, I would recommend that--for your peace of mind--you stay in some other part of town. I am leaving it up to my guests to decide for themselves if the risk is worth the thrifty price of the stay.

An Uber Pool or Lyft Line to Downtown Crossing only costs $3-$8 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 2 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$8--i.e. the average shared Uber/Lyft ride. An Uber X or private Lyft to Downtown Crossing only costs $8-$15 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 4 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$16--i.e. significantly more than the cost of a private Lyft or Uber X.

Maintain Realistic Expectations: -We may talk late in the kitchen. -Loud people won't quiet down unless you ask first. -We clean every day, but our bath tub is old and has some heavily discolored spots, so no amount of cleaning will make it look sparkling clean.

UBER/LYFT will save you time and stress, and sometimes even money. The public transit in Boston is ~$2/ride and, in my opinion, frustratingly slow (#spoiledinasia). Even though the triple bus pickup to the Ruggles metro and Dudley bus stations is incredibly convenient, I recommend tourists on a time clock utilize the ride-sharing apps UBER and LYFT. An Uber Pool or Lyft Line to Downtown Crossing only costs $3-$8 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 2 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$8--i.e. the average shared Uber/Lyft ride. An Uber X or private Lyft to Downtown Crossing only costs $8-$15 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 4 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$16--i.e. significantly more than the cost of a private Lyft or Uber X. Unfortunately, UBER/LYFT charge a premium from the airport, so that'll run you ~$20.

I grew up in Southern California, and I have lived in diverse, multi-cultural areas most of my life. However, you will see things such as: run down buildings, occasional graffiti, and homeless people panhandling down Melnea Cass Blvd in the warmer months, (mostly towards Massachusetts Ave.) The building was built in 1899, and the windows need updating, so you will hear noises such as: sirens, (the hospital and police station are both within close proximity,) and music and horns from the cars stopped at the traffic light out front. You may also hear: music from the unit below, people occasionally yelling outside, the doors closing in the building as the air pushes up the stairs, the clicking of the","Please remember that this is home sharing! My house is clean - but lived in - it will not be like a hotel. There may be stacks of books, kids toys, and occasional other things you will see.

There will be cat hair, and he will probably want to be in the room with you on the bed. (Feel free to shut him out, but please be careful not to lock him in.) The litter box is in a closet in the hall by the bathroom, please do not close that door.  If you are not a cat lover - or tolerant of animals - this is probably not the best place for you to stay.

I live within one mile of my grandparents' first rented apartments.  I'm still close to a rather large extended family and network of friends throughout the Boston area.  We have loved being here, for 3 generations in a row. In my professional life I am a health policy researcher and professor of medicine in Boston. Outside of family and work, my interests include art, architecture, and music.

Fort Hill and Highland Park are great for walking. In the mornings, head up to a revolutionary war fort (5 minutes) and an 1875 water standpipe that brought city plumbing to Roxbury. Eliot Square a few blocks away is home to an classic New England 1805 church, the oldest surviving wood structure church in the city.

If you're friendly and avoid being outside after nightfall (especially after most stores close at 8pm), things should be fine. If you suspect you'll feel uncomfortable, I would recommend that--for your peace of mind--you stay in some other part of town. I am leaving it up to my guests to decide for themselves if the risk is worth the thrifty price of the stay. With that said, the overwhelming majority of people are friendly, and I recommend relying on Uber/Lyft instead of public transit for reasons unrelated to safety. The peace of mind is a fringe benefit.","Check-out before 12pm. Check-in after 12pm.  ^ Cleaning done in the evenings after the hosts get off work.  ^ Clean towels and sheets accessible for those wanting to shower/nap beforehand. If you will be coming in a car, please pay attention to where you park on THURSDAY NIGHT. The city cleans one side of the street on Friday mornings, so everyone has to be parked on the opposite side of the street (or else you'll get towed). Follow the signs and you’ll be fine. :)  ^ Otherwise, the on-street parking is FREE. Please be cognizant of the fact that there will be about TEN GUESTS staying at any given time.  ^ Out of respect for the other 9 guests, you are expected to clean up after yourself in the kitchen and two bathrooms.

REFUND POLICY: This is an ECONOMY LISTING, so I ONLY offer refunds","If I don't cycle, I personally use UBER/LYFT to get everywhere. UBER/LYFT will save you time and stress, and sometimes even money. The public transit in Boston is ~$2/ride and, in my opinion, frustratingly slow (#spoiledinasia). Even though the triple bus pickup to the Ruggles metro and Dudley bus stations is incredibly convenient, I recommend tourists on a time clock utilize the ride-sharing apps UBER and LYFT. An Uber Pool or Lyft Line to Downtown Crossing only costs $3-$8 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 2 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$8--i.e. the average shared Uber/Lyft ride. An Uber X or private Lyft to Downtown Crossing only costs $8-$15 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 4 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$16--i.e. significantly more than the cost of a private Lyft or Uber X. Unfortunately, UBER/LYFT charge a premium from the airport, so that'll run you ~$20.

It is this unique chemistry between the guest and host that makes this interaction so fulfilling.  Curiosity, knowledge building, experience, kindness, intrigue, diversity and necessity all play a part.  To all guest past and future.... thank you.

An Uber X or private Lyft to Downtown Crossing only costs $8-$15 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 4 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$16--i.e. significantly more than the cost of a private Lyft or Uber X. Unfortunately, UBER/LYFT charge a premium from the airport, so that'll run you ~$20.

An Uber Pool or Lyft Line to Downtown Crossing only costs $3-$8 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 2 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$8--i.e. the average shared Uber/Lyft ride. An Uber X or private Lyft to Downtown Crossing only costs $8-$15 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 4 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$16--i.e. significantly more than the cost of a private Lyft or Uber X.
