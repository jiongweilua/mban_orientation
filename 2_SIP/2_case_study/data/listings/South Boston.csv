We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off",It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front. See the HOUSE MANUAL for parking tips. There is also Uber that can pickup/dropoff for inexpensive to downtown Boston. Approx $10 Uber ride to the Boston Convention Center (BCEC).,"The entire unit (kitchen, bathroom, living room, both bedrooms), and common coin-op laundry. Parking is on available the street (visitors OK), even in areas without a permit but you must pay attention to the street signs. Keyless entry system. As your arrival date nears, 1 day prior, you will be sent a message with instructions for electronic keycode access. Check in time is 3pm, and check out time is 11am - that gives us a 4 hour window to have my cleaning crew fully clean, disinfect, change sheets, for your arrival and the guest coming in after you. You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11am check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, as we may have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for my cleaning people to do the same. Unlike a hotel that has multiple rooms to shuffle around.","This is a fully contained private apartment so there is no need for direct interaction with guests, though we do like to meet you and you will see us around the building doing maintenance, etc.. You may call/text/email through here anytime as well. Before you arrive and after you leave, my cleaning crew will come in to clean and disinfect everything, replace all the sheets with newly clean ones. Please remember that check in time is 3pm and check out is 11am - this is important because I often have guests check in/out on the same days, back-to-back.","PLEASE close the front lobby door behind you after you enter and when you leave each time. It's a new door and it doesn't always latch on its own. PLEASE remove your shoes inside, and no smoking inside or nearby outside (because it drifts in) please. NO parties or loud music at any time, no smoking period - and definitely no loud noises before 9am or after 10pm, in consideration for our neighbors above, below, and to each side of the unit. The existence of Airbnb depends upon the kind consideration of our neighbors - please help us keep up good community relations. In an effort to help ensure you have quiet and peaceful enjoyment during your stay, we have surveillance video cameras in all the common areas of the building (which also detect loud audio) - of course, none inside the units.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

My name is Sarah, I was born in Morocco and have been a Bostonian for the past seven years. Prior to date, I lived and studied in France for seven years.

My childhood in Morocco taught me Arabic, French, empathy, respect, resourcefulness, flexibility and quick problem solving skills.

My parents gave me their thirst for learning and continuous improvement, their professionalism, work ethic and dedication.

My seven years in France sharpened my taste in European pastry, Caribbean music and fed my general knowledge.

My seven years so far in the US awakened my passion for running and thrift shopping.

Now ? I am :

- making my way in the fascinating world of Non Profit Project Management.
- running 10k every two days.
- learning Spanish.
- reading every book I can find by Marcel Rufin.
- watching religiously Suits every Thursday and Ballers every Sunday.

My husband and I have been using Airbnb as guests for the past 2 years and started hosting ourselves on August 2015. We are multilingual, curious about every other culture and traveling is basically a second nature (as much as an addiction).

Looking forward to meet you as guest or host (or who knows, maybe both).

Warm regards,

Sarah.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off",It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front. See the HOUSE MANUAL for parking tips. There is also Uber that can pickup/dropoff for inexpensive to downtown Boston. Approx $10 Uber ride to the Boston Convention Center (BCEC).,"The entire unit (kitchen, bathroom, living room, both bedrooms), and common coin-op laundry. Parking is on available the street (visitors OK) - see note on parking. Keyless entry system. As your arrival date nears, 1 day prior, you will be sent a message with instructions for electronic keycode access that are personalized for your stay. Check in time is 3pm, and check out time is 11am - that gives us a 4 hour window to have our cleaning crew fully clean, disinfect, change sheets, for your arrival and the guest coming in after you. You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11am check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, as we may have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for our cleaning people to do the same. Unlike a hotel that has multiple rooms to shuffle around, we have limited units to shuffle around.","This is a fully contained private apartment so there is no need for direct interaction with guests, though we do like to meet you and you will see us around the building doing maintenance, etc.. You may call/text/email through here anytime as well. Before you arrive and after you leave, our cleaning crew will come in to clean and disinfect everything, replace all the sheets with newly clean ones. Please remember that check in time is 3pm and check out is 11am - this is important because we often have guests check in/out on the same days, back-to-back.","PLEASE close the front lobby door behind you after you enter and when you leave each time. It's a new door and it doesn't always latch on its own. PLEASE remove your shoes inside, and no smoking inside or nearby outside (because it drifts in) please. NO parties or loud music at any time, no smoking period - and definitely no loud noises before 9am or after 10pm, in consideration for our neighbors above, below, and to each side of the unit. The existence of Airbnb depends upon the kind consideration of our neighbors - please help us keep up good community relations.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off","It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front. See the HOUSE MANUAL for parking tips. There is also Uber that can pickup/dropoff for inexpensive to downtown Boston. Approx $10 Uber ride to the Boston Convention Center (BCEC), or approx 30 minute walk.","The entire unit (kitchen, bathroom, living room, bedrooms), and common laundry. Parking is often available on the street during the daytime and weekends, but much more difficult at night and during snow emergencies. Keyless entry system. As your arrival date nears, 1 day prior, you will be sent a message with instructions for electronic keycode access. Check in time is 3pm, and check out time is 11am - that gives me a 4 hour window to have my cleaning crew fully clean, disinfect, change sheets, for your arrival and the guest coming in after you. You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11am check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, as I have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for my cleaning people to do the same. Unlike a hotel that has multiple rooms to shuffle around, that is not the case here.","This is a fully contained private apartment so there is no need for direct interaction with guests, though we do like to meet you and you will see us around the building doing maintenance, etc.. You may call/text/email through here anytime as well. Before you arrive and after you leave, our cleaning crew will come in to clean and disinfect everything, replace all the sheets with newly clean ones. Please remember that check in time is 3pm and check out is 11am - this is important because we often have guests check in/out on the same days, back-to-back.","PLEASE close the front lobby door behind you after you enter and when you leave each time. It's a new door and it doesn't always latch on its own. PLEASE remove your shoes inside, and no smoking inside or nearby outside (because it drifts in) please. NO parties or loud music at any time, no smoking period - and definitely no loud noises before 9am or after 10pm, in consideration for our neighbors above, below, and to each side of the unit. The existence of Airbnb depends upon the kind consideration of our neighbors - please help us keep up good community relations.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off","It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front. See the HOUSE MANUAL for parking tips. There is also Uber that can pickup/dropoff for inexpensive to downtown Boston. Approx $10 Uber ride to the Boston Convention Center (BCEC), or approx 30 minute walk.","EACH OF TWO UNITS: The entire unit (kitchen, bathroom, living room, both bedrooms), and common coin-op laundry. Parking is on available the street (visitors OK) - see note on parking. Keyless entry system. As your arrival date nears, 1 day prior, you will be sent a message with instructions for electronic keycode access that are personalized for your stay. Check in time is 3pm, and check out time is 11am - that gives us a 4 hour window to have our cleaning crew fully clean, disinfect, change sheets, for your arrival and the guest coming in after you. You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11am check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, as we may have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for our cleaning people to do the same. Unlike a hotel that has multiple rooms to shuffle around, we have limited units to shuffle around.","EACH is a fully contained private apartment (except for the common staircase between the two units) so there is no need for direct interaction with guests, though we do like to meet you and you will see us around the building doing maintenance, etc.. You may call/text/email through here anytime as well. Before you arrive and after you leave, our cleaning crew will come in to clean and disinfect everything, replace all the sheets with newly clean ones. Please remember that check in time is 3pm and check out is 11am - this is important because we often have guests check in/out on the same days, back-to-back.","PLEASE close the front lobby door behind you after you enter and when you leave each time. It's a new door and it doesn't always latch on its own. PLEASE remove your shoes inside, and no smoking inside or nearby outside (because it drifts in) please. NO parties or loud music at any time, no smoking period - and definitely no loud noises before 9am or after 10pm, in consideration for our neighbors above, below, and to each side of the unit. The existence of Airbnb depends upon the kind consideration of our neighbors - please help us keep up good community relations. In an effort to help ensure you have quiet and peaceful enjoyment during your stay, we have surveillance video cameras in all the common areas of the building (which also detect loud audio) - of course, none inside the units.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off","It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front.

You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11am check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, as we may have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for our cleaning people to do the same.

I am Joanna, a current candidate in a Master’s program in Sustainable International Development at Brandeis! As a student in an international program, I truly value traveling in addition to music and other hobbies involving exploring the world. I believe Airbnb is a great platform for anyone who wants to travel and enjoys visiting different places and cultures! 
 
I've lived in Spain, grew up in North Carolina, and now consider myself a Bostonian. My home in South Boston is very comfortable and right next the beach where I enjoy jogging in the mornings! I would like to share my place while I'm Airbnbing since I believe my home will bring happiness and a true Boston experience :) 
 
When I'm not traveling or studying, I enjoy nonfiction books such as ""A New Earth Awakening"" By Eckhart Tolle or simply relaxing at the beach near Castle Island. 
 
As a host, I will do my best to provide you with a very comfortable stay in my home and provide with the very best tips for visiting Boston. As a guest, I will respect your home and truly appreciate the space given to me.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off","It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off","It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front.

We ask you to remove your shoes while inside the units. Boston homes are full of charm, but are also some of the oldest in the country and thus the walls and floors are thin – and sound travels. Removing your shoes helps to both protect our floors, but also ensures the people below you also quietly enjoy their stay. 2. No loud noises before 9am and after 10pm. As noted above, sound travels. Our unit has a device by Netatmo, called the Home Health Coach, and it measures air quality/pollution, humidity, temperature, and noise levels – and amongst other things, alerts us when noise levels get too high. Sounds are NOT recorded though. 3. For your safety, we also have a Leeo which monitors for the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarms and notifies us if they sound off, so as to keep you safe. We get notified if an alarm goes off",It's walking distance (10 mins) from 2 red-line subways that will take you to downtown Boston and Cambridge. There is also a bus stop right out front.

Parking is often available on the street during the daytime and weekends, but much more difficult at night and during snow emergencies. Keyless entry system. As your arrival date nears, 1 day prior, you will be sent a message with instructions for electronic keycode access. Check in time is 3pm, and check out time is 11am - that gives us a 4 hour window to have our cleaning crew fully clean, disinfect, change sheets, for your arrival and the guest coming in after you. You can check in anytime thereafter. Please note that this also means that the 11a check out must be strictly adhered to on your last day, as we may have another guest checking in that afternoon, and need time for our cleaning people to do the same. Unlike a hotel that has multiple rooms to shuffle around, that is not the case here.","This is a fully contained private apartment so there is no need for direct interaction with guests, though we do like to meet you and you will see us around the building doing maintenance, etc.. You may call/text/email through here anytime as well. Before you arrive and after you leave, my cleaning crew will come in to clean and disinfect everything, replace all the sheets with newly clean ones. Please remember that check in time is 3pm and check out is 11am - this is important because I often have guests check in/out on the same days, back-to-back.","- PLEASE close the front lobby door behind you after you enter and when you leave each time. It's a new door and it doesn't always latch on its own. - PLEASE remove your shoes inside, and no smoking inside or nearby outside (because it drifts in) please. -  NO parties or loud music at any time, no smoking period - and definitely no loud noises before 9am or after 10pm, in consideration for our neighbors above, below, and to each side of the unit. The existence of Airbnb depends upon the kind consideration of our neighbors - please help us keep up good community relations. In an effort to help ensure you have quiet and peaceful enjoyment during your stay, we have surveillance video cameras in all the common areas of the building (which also detect loud audio) - of course, none inside the units.
