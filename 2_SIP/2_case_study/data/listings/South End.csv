MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

Today, I spend most of my time managing my apartment rentals, but I recently spent 9 months in Buenos Aires, a year in France to improve my French, 10 days on the FRAM touring Antarctica and 5 days on the INCA TRAIL from Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu.


MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

Today, I spend most of my time managing my apartment rentals, but I recently spent 9 months in Buenos Aires, a year in France to improve my French, 10 days on the FRAM touring Antarctica and 5 days on the INCA TRAIL from Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu.


MY INTERESTS

I’m an art lover, my inspiration is Boston’s own Isabella Stewart Gardner and my objective is to make the house look like an art museum, but still retain all the comforts of home!

I’m dedicated to healthy living and love discussing topics from diet to neuroscience. I literally can't live without enough sleep, healthy food, and exercise!

I’m an avid reader, with a huge personal library on display throughout the house- I’ve been in my local book club for over 20 years.

I’m a Francophile. I study French but I'm in need of some exercises and classes to bring my conversational French up to speed! So I meet with neighbors here in the south End every 2nd and 4th Tuesday to speak in French over lunch!

Theater, I'm a big supporter and have even been in many plays myself. I also sing in the Boston Gay Men's Choir.

The neighborhood is home to many fine restaurants, cafes, galleries, shops, and bars. It is very walkable and ideal for sightseeing at many attractions. There are eleven parks nearby, perfect for a relaxing after dinner stroll. Despite becoming very gentrified in the past 30 years, the location has a rich history of attracting diverse groups of people. The neighborhood was originally built in 1849 on tidal marshes to divert the city’s population from the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The first waves of residents included new immigrants residing in rooming houses (more likely than not, our house was one!), followed by a burgeoning middle class that included business owners and bankers. In the 1920s, settlement houses were being built as a way for the city to bring people of different socio-economic classes toget",Please note: *Our homeshare is not a full-service hotel.
