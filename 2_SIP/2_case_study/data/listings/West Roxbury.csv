I am an avid user of the AirBnB platform as both a host and a guest and am very glad to be part of this awesome community.  As a host, I focus on treating my guests the way I would like to be treated!  A lot of time and effort is spent to ensure the house is well decorated and clean, bed sheets and towels are washed and ironed, and all the basic necessities are available so that guests feel as if they have found a home away from home! 

When I am not hosting guests from around the world in Boston, I go out and explore the world and stay in AirBnB properties regularly.  I treat my host homes as I would my own and am always happy to talk and get to know my hosts and their recommendations!

Thank you for being part of this community and reading my profile. I hope we can connect soon!
