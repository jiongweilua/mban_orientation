# Case Study: Navigating the Cycle of Data Science

*Instructor: [Phil Chodrow](https://philchodrow.com)*

Data science is rarely cut-and-dried; each analysis typically provides answers but also raises new questions. This makes the data scientific process fundamentally cyclical:

In this session, we will work through a complex case study that requires multiple iterations of manipulation, visualization, and modeling in order to test a data scientific hypothesis. Along the way, we will learn how to use advanced tools from the `tidyverse` set of packages to smoothly transition between these stages of the data-scientific methods. 

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Pose a data scientific hypothesis and plan analyses by which test it. 
2. Use advanced data manipulation and visualization to explore complex data sets. 
3. Craft efficient, tidy, and iterative data pipelines using basic functional programming tools. 
4. Perform tidy model inspection and selection with `broom`.
